GeocoderExample
===============

Simple Mapbox geocoder experimentation with Swift. 

The meat of what you want is in `./Geocoder Example/MapboxGeocoder.swift`. Import that file into your project and then use `MBGeocoder` just like you would use `CLGeocoder` (at least for reverse geocoding... for now).
