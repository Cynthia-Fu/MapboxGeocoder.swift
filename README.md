MapboxGeocoder.swift
====================

[Mapbox geocoder](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/geocoding/) in Swift. 

Import `MapboxGeocoder.framework` into your project, then use `MBGeocoder` as a drop-in replacement for Apple's `CLGeocoder`.

Includes example applications written in both Swift and Objective-C showing use of the framework (as well as a comparison of writing apps in either language). 

Head straight to [`MapboxGeocoder.swift`](https://github.com/incanus/GeocoderExample/blob/master/MBGeocoder/MapboxGeocoder.swift) if you want to see the guts of the library.
